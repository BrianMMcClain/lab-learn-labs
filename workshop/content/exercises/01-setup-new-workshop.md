A workshop template can be found at [https://github.com/eduk8s/lab-markdown-sample](https://github.com/eduk8s/lab-markdown-sample). To get started, you can generate a new repository from the template right on GitHub. In this case however, we'll clone the repository locally:

```execute
git clone https://github.com/BrianMMcClain/lab-learn-labs.git
```

Take a look at the files contained in the repositroy:

```execute
cd lab-markdown-sample
tree
```

Look familiar? These files together create a simple workshop that exmplains the markdown used in creating your very own workshop. Let's take a look at some of them!
