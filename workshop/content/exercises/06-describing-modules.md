Let's take a look at the `modules.yaml` file, which describes each module in the workshop:

```editor:open-file
file: ~/lab-learn-labs/workshop/modules.yaml
```

Each entry under `modules` describes each module in the workshop. For example, `exercises/06-describing-modules` describes this very module! In the simplest form, this is just the title of the module, but you can also define the label on the button that moves to the next module using the `exit_sign` property.
